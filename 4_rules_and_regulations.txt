RULES AND REGULATIONS
FOR
RIVENDALE AT MILL CREEK, A CONDOMINIUM

Amended xxx 2018

We live in close proximity at Rivendale and these Rules and Regulations are intended to assist in
promoting common sense and courtesy in our neighborhood without infringing on our enjoyment
of our properties.  These Rules and Regulations apply to all members of our community.  Every
unit owner is responsible for the conduct of family members, tenants, and guests alike.

Failure to comply with any of the following Rules and Regulations may result in the Rivendale
Homeowners Association Board of Directors issuing a warning letter, assessing a fine, or taking
other appropriate actions for behavior or actions that are not conducive to community living in a
condominium community.

**See fine schedule adopted 10/09/2013

***Common and Limited Common Elements as defined by the Rivendale CC&R’s.

1. Noise: Owners shall exercise extreme care in making noises or in the use of musical instruments,
radios, televisions, and amplifiers that may disturb other residents. The City of
Mill Creek Municipal Code Chapter 9.14 also applies to Rivendale. Quiet Hours are
9:00 pm through 7:00 am on weekdays and 9:00 pm through 8:00 am on weekends.

2. Decks:
  A. Owners shall not hang garments, rugs, etc., from the windows or from any of the decks or
facades of the condominium.

  B. Owners shall not dust rugs, etc., from the windows or decks, or clean rugs, etc., by beating
them on the exterior of a building.

  C. No accumulation of garbage, waste, boxes, inoperable items, or dead plants may be
stored on decks or patios.

3. Common Areas: Personal items may not be stored on common areas.

4. Garbage: Discarding trash, including cigarettes or cigarette butts, on the common or limited
common elements of Rivendale is strictly forbidden. Garbage and Recycle bins must be
stored inside the unit but may be placed on the curb, driveway, or walk way in front of the
unit for up to 24 hours for the regularly scheduled collection date.

5. Parking/Vehicles:
  A. Vehicles shall only be parked in marked parking spaces, garages or driveways, with
the exception of immediate loading or unloading of the vehicle. Vehicles parked in
driveways shall not have any portion of the vehicle envelope extend past the red "FIRE LANE NO
PARKING" line on the curb (including tow-hitches, side-mirrors, and other such extensions).
Any vehicle in violation of this regulation may be towed and impounded immediately without
notice at the expense of the vehicle owner.

  B. NO PARKING AT ANY TIME IN A FIRE LANE. Fire lanes are marked. Our
streets are too narrow in many places for the fire truck to get through if a car is parked
illegally. The local Fire Marshal requires no less than 20 feet of clearance. Any vehicle in
violation of this regulation may be towed and impounded immediately without notice at the
expense of the vehicle owner.

  C. All owners, tenants and guests at Rivendale are required to observe the speed limit of
5 miles per hour or slower. 

  D. All vehicles parked on the property shall be passenger motor vehicles in good mechanical
condition, be fully-operable, and kept clean and free of debris. They shall have a current, valid
registration with the State of Washington. Any vehicle in violation of this regulation may be
towed and impounded immediately with 3-days notice at the expense of the vehicle owner.

  E. All vehicles parked on the property shall not leave any debris or fluids on the pavement.
Debris and fluids includes grease, dirt, rocks, trash, etc. The vehicle owner shall be held
responsible for the clean-up and any pavement repairs required due to debris or fluids.

  F. All vehicles parked on the property shall not display any "For-Sale" signs visible externally
from the vehicle.

  G. Common area parking shall be defined as lined parking stalls or individual concrete pads
between buildings. 10% of the common area parking is to be used exclusively for Visitor Parking.

  H. Limited common area parking shall be defined as the areas in front of garage doors that are
large enough to accomodate a vehicle without violating section 5.A.

  I. Marked common and limited common area parking shall be used only for unit owners, their
tenants, or authorized visitors. If the owner rents out their unit, the parking privileges are
transfered to their tenant for the duration of their lease and shall not be used by the owner.

  J. Garages are intended, and by-definition, for the storage of the occupant's vehicles. All
units were originally constructed to house two or more four-wheeled vehicles. Any available
space over that requirement may be used for other applications.

    i. Occupants with 1-2 four-wheeled vehicles shall park at least 1 vehicle in their garage.

    ii. Occupants with 3-4 four-wheeled vehicles shall park at least 2 vehicles in their garage.

external to Rivendale for the storage of those vehicles over the 4 vehicle limit.

occupant's vehicle is occupying a commmon-element parking space.

  K. Vehicle Tracking:
    i. All vehicles kept on the property by unit owners and renters shall be registered with the
Board and display a tag (sticker, decal, placard, etc.) indicating as such.

Exceptions for short-term rental cars, repair shop loan vehicles, etc. may be accommodated through
a written request to the Board or its agent.

    ii. Tags shall be available through the Board or its agent. Information required for the
registration includes license plate identifiers, vehicle make/model, owner name, owner unit number,
valid contact phone number, and valid contact email address. The tags will have identifiers that
may be looked up by the Board or its agent to locate the owner of the vehicle if there are any
questions or concerns.

    iii. Each unit shall be assigned two visitor tags for their visitors. Lost visitor tags may be
replaced at $ 50.00 per tag.

    iv. When vehicles are dispossesed or new vehicles acquired, the Board shall be notified within
48 hours with the information required in section 5.G.i. License plate identifiers shall be
provided when they are issued. A temporary email-message-permit may be printed and used until the
License plate identifiers are available. A permanent tag shall then be issued.

  L. All vehicles in common area parking shall be parked Head-In-First.

  M. Common area parking shall be limited to motorcycles, cars or trucks no longer than 20 feet
(including tow-hitches, side-mirrors, and other such extensions). This excludes shipping
containers, trailers, etc. unless the Board has provided prior, written approval. Moving containers
(e.g. PODs) may occupy no more than one parking space for no more than 24 hours. Longer terms may
be accommodated with prior written consent from the Board. Permitted container combinations are two
7 foot by 7 foot containers or a single 8 foot by 12 foot container.

hours. Longer periods of time may be arranged with prior written approval of the Board.

with the movement of other vehicles.

  P. Vehicular repair shall not be performed in common or limited common area parking. It may be
performed in the occupants garage as long as safety requirements are observed and hazardous chemical
and noise rules are followed. The association nor the Board nor its agent shall not be held
responsible for any injuries or damage from such activities.
  
  Q. Failure to adhere to the above vehicular and parking rules and regulations may result in the
vehicle being removed and/or result in a fine per the 2013 Rivendale at Mill Creek Owners
Association Fine Schedule Policy Resolution.

6. Plants: No one may plant anything in the common elements at Rivendale without the
express prior approval of the Rivendale Homeowners Board of Directors. 

7. Building Alterations: Owners shall not install wiring for electrical or telephone installation,
television antennae, machines, or air conditioning units, etc., on the exterior of a building,

any alterations to the common elements, limited common elements, penetrations of

9. For Sale Signs: There are to be no “For Sale” signs “planted” in any of the grounds,
common, or limited common elements of Rivendale without the prior approval of the
Rivendale Board of Directors or its agent (i.e. property management company). This rule
is in place, in part, to prevent damage to the landscaping and irrigation system. Any
owner receiving permission from the Rivendale Homeowners Board of Directors, or its
agent, to install a sign will be required to place a deposit of $300, or the equivalent of one
month worth of Homeowners Association Dues, which ever is larger, prior to installing a
sign. Installation of any "For Sale Sign" may only be done in strict accordance with the
directions of the Rivendale Homeowners Association Board or its agent. Failure to
comply with the directions of the Rivendale Homeowners Association Board of Directors
or its agent will result in the immediate removal of the sign at the expense of the
homeowner and or the real estate agent. Upon removal of the sign the deposit may be
refunded if the sign is removed without damage to the property.

10. Homeowners Dues: Homeowners Association Dues are due on the first of each month. A
late fee of $50 will be assessed for dues received after the 10th of the month for which
they are due. $50 will be assessed for each month that an account has an outstanding
balance.

When an account becomes 30 days delinquent the Homeowner will receive a written
warning about the delinquent account. 

When an account becomes 60 days delinquent, a second warning letter will be sent to the
Homeowner, warning that if payment is not received, or a payment plan submitted and
approved by the Rivendale Board of Directors, a lien will be placed on the property. 

At 90 days delinquent a lien will be placed on the property, with a written notification to
the homeowner. The homeowner is responsible for all costs, including court and attorney
fees for the filing of the lien.

At 120 days delinquent, the Rivendale Board will pursue foreclosure, Sheriff’s sale or
other means available to the Association to recover the funds delinquent on the property.
