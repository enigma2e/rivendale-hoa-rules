RULES AND REGULATIONS
FOR
RIVENDALE AT MILL CREEK, A CONDOMINIUM

Amended December 2015

We live in close proximity at Rivendale and these Rules and Regulations are intended to assist in
promoting common sense and courtesy in our neighborhood without infringing on our enjoyment
of our properties.  These Rules and Regulations apply to all members of our community.  Every
unit owner is responsible for the conduct of family members, tenants, and guests alike.

Failure to comply with any of the following Rules and Regulations may result in the Rivendale
Homeowners Association Board of Directors issuing a warning letter, assessing a fine, or taking
other appropriate actions for behavior or actions that are not conducive to community living in a
condominium community.

**See fine schedule adopted 10/09/2013

***Common and Limited Common Elements as defined by the Rivendale CC&R’s.

1. Noise: Owners shall exercise extreme care in making noises or in the use of musical instruments,
radios, televisions, and amplifiers that may disturb other residents. The City of
Mill Creek Municipal Code Chapter 9.14 also applies to Rivendale. Quiet Hours are
9:00 pm through 7:00 am on weekdays and 9:00 pm through 8:00 am on weekends.

2. Decks:
  A. Owners shall not hang garments, rugs, etc., from the windows or from any of the decks or
facades of the condominium.

  B. Owners shall not dust rugs, etc., from the windows or decks, or clean rugs, etc., by beating
them on the exterior of a building.

  C. No accumulation of garbage, waste, boxes, inoperable items, or dead plants may be
stored on decks or patios.

3. Common Areas: Personal items may not be stored on common areas.

4. Garbage: Discarding trash, including cigarettes or cigarette butts, on the common or limited
common elements of Rivendale is strictly forbidden. Garbage and Recycle bins must be
stored inside the unit but may be placed on the curb, driveway, or walk way in front of the
unit for up to 24 hours for the regularly scheduled collection date.

5. Parking/Vehicles:
  A. Vehicles may only be parked in marked parking spaces, garages or driveways, with
the exception of immediate loading or unloading of the vehicle. Vehicles parked in
driveways may not have any portion of their tire on the blacktop of the roadway.
Any vehicle in violation of this regulation may be towed and impounded immediately without
notice at the expense of the vehicle owner.

  B. NO PARKING AT ANY TIME IN A FIRE LANE. Fire lanes are marked. Our
streets are too narrow in many places for the fire truck to get through if a car is parked
illegally.

  C. All vehicles parked on the property must be operable passenger motor vehicles. They
must also be currently legally registered.

  D. All owners, tenants and guests at Rivendale are required to observe the speed limit of
5 miles per hour or slower. 

6. Plants: No one may plant anything in the common elements at Rivendale without the
express prior approval of the Rivendale Homeowners Board of Directors. 

7. Building Alterations: Owners shall not install wiring for electrical or telephone installation,
television antennae, machines, or air conditioning units, etc., on the exterior of a building,
or that protrudes through the walls of a unit or the roof of a building, and shall not make
any alterations to the common elements, limited common elements, penetrations of
siding, belly bands, etc., except as authorized in writing by the Board.

8. Pets: Owners shall keep their pets inside their units. Dogs shall be kept on a leash when not
in the unit. Owners shall clean up their dogs' waste. Owners shall take
sufficient steps to prevent their pets from unreasonably disturbing other owners and shall
remove any pet which they cannot sufficiently control. Owners are reminded to be in
compliance with the City of Mill Creek Municipal Code regarding Pets, Chapter 6.02.

9. For Sale Signs: There are to be no “For Sale” signs “planted” in any of the grounds,
common, or limited common elements of Rivendale without the prior approval of the
Rivendale Board of Directors or its agent (i.e. property management company). This rule
is in place, in part, to prevent damage to the landscaping and irrigation system. Any
owner receiving permission from the Rivendale Homeowners Board of Directors, or its
agent, to install a sign will be required to place a deposit of $300, or the equivalent of one
month worth of Homeowners Association Dues, which ever is larger, prior to installing a
sign. Installation of any "For Sale Sign" may only be done in strict accordance with the
directions of the Rivendale Homeowners Association Board or its agent. Failure to
comply with the directions of the Rivendale Homeowners Association Board of Directors
or its agent will result in the immediate removal of the sign at the expense of the
homeowner and or the real estate agent. Upon removal of the sign the deposit may be
refunded if the sign is removed without damage to the property.

10. Homeowners Dues: Homeowners Association Dues are due on the first of each month. A
late fee of $50 will be assessed for dues received after the 10th of the month for which
they are due. $50 will be assessed for each month that an account has an outstanding
balance.

When an account becomes 30 days delinquent the Homeowner will receive a written
warning about the delinquent account. 

When an account becomes 60 days delinquent, a second warning letter will be sent to the
Homeowner, warning that if payment is not received, or a payment plan submitted and
approved by the Rivendale Board of Directors, a lien will be placed on the property. 

At 90 days delinquent a lien will be placed on the property, with a written notification to
the homeowner. The homeowner is responsible for all costs, including court and attorney
fees for the filing of the lien.

At 120 days delinquent, the Rivendale Board will pursue foreclosure, Sheriff’s sale or
other means available to the Association to recover the funds delinquent on the property.
