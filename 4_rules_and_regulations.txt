RULES AND REGULATIONS
FOR
RIVENDALE AT MILL CREEK, A CONDOMINIUM

Amended xxx 2018

We live in close proximity at Rivendale and these Rules and Regulations are intended to assist in
promoting common sense and courtesy in our neighborhood without infringing on our enjoyment
of our properties. These Rules and Regulations apply to all members of our community.  Every
unit owner is responsible for the conduct of family members, tenants, and guests alike.

Failure to comply with any of the following Rules and Regulations may result in the Rivendale
Homeowners Association Board of Directors issuing a warning letter, assessing a fine, or taking
other appropriate actions for behavior or actions that are not conducive to community living in a
condominium community.

**See fine schedule adopted 10/09/2013

***Common and Limited Common Elements as defined by the Rivendale CC&R’s.

1. Noise: Owners shall exercise extreme care in making noises or in the use of musical instruments,
radios, televisions, and amplifiers that may disturb other residents. The City of
Mill Creek Municipal Code Chapter 9.14 also applies to Rivendale. Quiet Hours are
9:00 pm through 7:00 am on weekdays and 9:00 pm through 8:00 am on weekends.

2. Decks:
  A. Owners shall not hang garments, rugs, etc., from the windows or from any of the decks or
facades of the condominium.

  B. Owners shall not dust rugs, etc., from the windows or decks, or clean rugs, etc., by beating
them on the exterior of a building.

  C. Garbage, waste, boxes, inoperable items, or dead plants shall not accumulate nor be stored on
decks or patios.

3. Common Areas: Personal items shall not be stored on common areas.

4. Garbage: Discarding trash, including cigarettes or cigarette butts, on the common or limited
common elements of Rivendale is strictly forbidden. Garbage and Recycle bins shall be stored inside
the unit but may be placed on the curb, driveway, or walk way in front of the unit for up to 24 hours
before the regularly scheduled collection date and shall be removed the same day garbage was collected.

5. Parking/Vehicles:
  A. Vehicles shall only be parked in marked parking spaces, garages or driveways, with
the exception of immediate loading or unloading of the vehicle. Vehicles parked in
driveways shall not have any portion of the vehicle envelope extend past the red "FIRE LANE NO
PARKING" line on the curb (including tow-hitches, side-mirrors, and other such extensions).
Any vehicle in violation of this regulation may be towed and impounded immediately without
notice at the expense of the vehicle owner.

  B. NO PARKING AT ANY TIME IN A FIRE LANE. Fire lanes are marked. Our
streets are too narrow in many places for the fire truck to get through if a car is parked
illegally. The local Fire Marshal requires no less than 20 feet of clearance. Any vehicle in
violation of this regulation may be towed and impounded immediately without notice at the
expense of the vehicle owner.

  C. All owners, tenants and guests at Rivendale are required to observe the speed limit of
5 miles per hour or slower. 

  D. All vehicles parked on the property shall be passenger motor vehicles in good mechanical
condition, be fully-operable, and kept clean and free of debris. They shall have a current, valid
registration with the State of Washington. Any vehicle in violation of this regulation may be
towed and impounded immediately with 3-days notice at the expense of the vehicle owner.

  E. All vehicles parked on the property shall not leave any debris or fluids on the pavement.
Debris and fluids includes grease, dirt, rocks, trash, etc. The vehicle owner shall be held
responsible for the clean-up and any pavement repairs required due to debris or fluids.

  F. All vehicles parked on the property shall not display any "For-Sale" signs visible externally
from the vehicle.

  G. Common area parking shall be defined as lined parking stalls or individual concrete pads
between buildings. 10% of the common area parking is to be used exclusively for Visitor Parking.

  H. Limited common area parking shall be defined as the areas in front of garage doors that are
large enough to accomodate a vehicle without violating section 5.A.

  I. Marked common and limited common area parking shall be used only for unit owners, their
tenants, or authorized visitors. If the owner rents out their unit, the parking privileges are

  J. Garages are intended, and by-definition, for the storage of the occupant's vehicles. All

    ii. Tags shall be available through the Board or its agent. Information required for the
registration includes license plate identifiers, vehicle make/model, owner name, owner unit number,
valid contact phone number, and valid contact email address. The tags will have identifiers that
may be looked up by the Board or its agent to locate the owner of the vehicle if there are any
questions or concerns.

    iii. Each unit shall be assigned two visitor tags for their visitors. Lost visitor tags may be
replaced at $ 50.00 per tag.

    iv. When vehicles are dispossesed or new vehicles acquired, the Board shall be notified within
48 hours with the information required in section 5.G.i. License plate identifiers shall be
provided when they are issued. A temporary email-message-permit may be printed and used until the

and noise rules are followed. The association nor the Board nor its agent shall not be held
responsible for any injuries or damage from such activities.
